# 🧠 Arithmetic AI Agent using LLaMA & Groq

This project demonstrates a simple yet powerful **ReAct-style AI agent** using the **LlamaIndex framework** and **Groq LLaMA-3.1** model. The agent is designed to handle basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using tool-augmented reasoning via the LLM.

## 🚀 Features

- 🤖 **LLaMA-3.1-based LLM** powered by Groq for fast, low-latency inference  
- 🛠️ **Tool integration** using LlamaIndex's `FunctionTool` API  
- 🧮 Performs arithmetic operations via ReAct agent reasoning  
- 🔁 Interactive agent loop to solve queries like "What is 27 multiplied by 3, then subtract 4?"
